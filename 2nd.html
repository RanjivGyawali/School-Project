                        The Surrender at Appomattox Courthouse occurred in April 1865 during
                        <br>
                        the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee, thought
                        <br>
                        that the Confederate would lose since the Union had way more resources
                        <br>and they were well prepared for a war so he gave up to the Union
                        <br>
                        General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse.This surrender
                        <br>
                        signaled the end of the Civil War. General Grant was kind enough
                        <br>
                         to not betray General Ulysses and the confederate soldiers,
                         <br>
                         letting them keep their horses and providing them with food.
                         <br> This event was a major event because it signaled the Northern
                         <br> states and the Southern states would reunite.

                        Abraham Lincoln was a major reason for the surrender at<br>
                        Appomattox Courthouse but he sadly was also assassinated<br>
                        for that reason. Since John Wilkes Booth, from the<br>
                        Confederate thought that there was a chance the Confederate<br>
                        could still win even after the surrender. He thought that <br>
                        if they assassinate the people who are in higher ranks<br>
                        of the Union then the whole Union would collapse and the<br>
                        Confederate would win. But only Lincoln’s assassination<br>
                        was done since his other partners failed.

                    <div class="des">
                        Even though he wasn’t physically in the Civil war, he is still <br>
                        related to it. Wilmer McLean lived in Manassas, Virginia and <br>
                        the 1st major battle that marked the beginning of the Civil <br>
                        war occurred in his property. After the battle, he moved into <br>
                        Central Virginia and COINCIDENTALLY the end of the Civil war <br>
                        also happened inside his house because he likely had the best <br>
                        house in Virginia where the end of the war was decided to <br>
                        happen. Now even though he tried to not be connected to the<br>
                        Civil war, at the end he became very connected to it.

                        Robert E. Lee, commonly known as the general of the confederate, <br>
                        played a huge role in the Civil War. He is known for his skills <br>
                        of taking the right decision and his leadership. Lee most likely <br>
                        made the most major decision of the whole Civil War that changed <br>
                        everything. In April 9th, 1865 Lee surrendered to the General of <br>
                        the Union known as General Grant due to extreme circumstances, <br>
                        saving many lives from the war that could have been even more  <br>
                        deadly. Even though some people think that he was a coward, he <br>
                        had made the right decision because the Confederate was already <br>
                        likely to lose due to lack of resources and support from other countries.
